# Probability Calculator

## Description
This is a basic Python CLI application that employs the copy, random, and unittest modules to record the probability of randomly pulling different colored balls out of a hat. The code was initially created on replit, but transferred over to Github for easier access and workflow for potential future development/collaboration.

## Usage
In `main.py`, add the properties to your new instance of the `Hat` class from `prob_calculator.py` and the initial amount of colored balls within your new object. Then, use the methods created in `prob_calculator.py` to draw certain colored balls or record the probability of pulling certain colors from the hat! You will need to add `print("Probability:", probability)` if it does not already exist in the `main.py`. Then, run the following command in the terminal to view your final probability: `python3 main.py`.

If you would like to run the unit tests, please run `python3 test_modules.py` in the terminal.
